Hello, I'm Subhash, and I currently work at Deloitte as a DC Analyst with 2.5 years of experience.

I'm good at tackling challenges by breaking them down into manageable steps and simplifying complex problems, having client facing project exprience.
I made sure to understand their needs and expectations, which helped us communicate smoothly and build positive working relationships.

In terms of technical skills, I'm confident in handling application states using React libraries like Redux. 
I'm also comfortable creating backend RESTful APIs with Express and managing data using MongoDB.

In recognition of my work, I've received several awards, including the Applause Award for being a supportive team member,
a Spot Award, and 2 R&R Awards for my excellent handling of CR changes as lead.

I'm passionate about driving innovation and I enjoy taking on new challenges, especially in fast-paced environments.

I joined UpGrad because I'm interested in exploring the world of Full Stack web development. As someone who works on the frontend,
I'm excited to learn more about building entire web applications using JavaScript. My goal is to become a skilled Full Stack Developer and create comprehensive 
solutions that utilize the capabilities of this versatile language.
